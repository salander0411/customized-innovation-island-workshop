These are optional questions and challenges about this application.

Now you can see what QuickSight can do, there are three advanced challenges to complete. To learn more about how to use the tools to complete these challenges, [refer to the Amazon QuickSight Quick Start Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/quickstart.html).

### 1. Free on your birthday 

Park Management is considering offering free entrance to anyone on their birthday. Tickets are currently $89 a day. Create a visualation showing how many visitors today celebrated their birthdays, and what the total cost of the program would be, based on today's attendance.

### 2. Staffing the turnstiles

(a) Park Management is looking to optimize staffing at the park entrance. There are 100 turnstiles, each capable of processing 10 visitor wristbands per minute. One staff member can manage two turnstiles. Produce a visualization showing the number of visitor arrivals throughout the day, by minute, and make a recommendation for turnstile staffing throughout the day.

(b) Turnstile employees take a one hour lunch. When would be the best time to schedule lunchtime for most of these employees?

(c) Total park capacity is 50,000 people. Can you also explain why the arrival numbers drop sharply after a couple of hours?

### 3. Which rides are not performing?

Park Management is concerned that some rides are popular with visitors. Create a visualation to show the 3 least popular rides.

(a) Show if the ratings vary significantly by age group.

(b) Executives are concerned that ride uptime may be impacting visitor satisfaction. Show if the ratings increase or decrease throughout the day.
