4. Open a text editor on your local machine, and paste the following contents. Ensure you enter your S3 bucket name
(the bucket beginning with `theme-park-data`) and save the file as `manifest.json`.

```
{
   "fileLocations":[
      {
         "URIPrefixes":[
            "s3://ENTER-YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/"
         ]
      }
   ],
   "globalUploadSettings":{
      "format":"JSON"
   }
}
```

5. On the *New S3 data source* form:
- Enter `theme-park-data` for *Date source name*.
- Select the *Upload* radio button.
- Choose the file uploader icon and select the manifest file saved in the previous step.
- Choose **Connect**.

### Prepare the data

You must change the datatypes of some fields for QuickSight to use these properly in visualization.

1. On the left of the page, there is the list of fields found in the dataset. Hover your mouse over the *visitor.home.latitude* field, click the elipsis (...), select *Change data type* and then select **Latitude**.

2. Hover your mouse over the *visitor.home.longitude* field, click the elipsis (...), select *Change data type* and then select **Longitude**.

2. Hover your mouse over the *rating* field, click the elipsis (...), select *Change data type* and then select **Integer**.


4. Choose **Add calculated field**.
- For *Name*, enter **minutesInPark**.

3. Choose **Create analysis**.

![Your data sets](/images/module5-3-configure11.png)

4. In the analysis dashboard, note the following areas on the display, since you will need these to build the data visualizations:
- 1 - Analysis menu bar.
- 2 - Fields list.
- 3 - Visualization types.
- 4 - Field wells, for modifying fields in visualizations.
- 5 - Worksheet, containing multiple visualization panels.

![Analysis dashboard](/images/module5-3-configure-12.png)

Each of the visualization challenges is completed using the analysis dashboard. 

## Building visualizations

Add each of the following visualizations to your analysis dashboard:

1. Average length of park visit by age. [Go to instructions...](./3-quicksight/1-visual.html)
2. Where are the visitors from? [Go to instructions...](./3-quicksight/2-visual.html)
3. Arrival time by visitor age. [Go to instructions...](./3-quicksight/3-visual.html)
4. Ride rating by popularity. [Go to instructions...](./3-quicksight/4-visual.html)
5. How many total rides today? [Go to instructions...](./3-quicksight/5-visual.html)

Once you have the five visualulations on your worksheet, rename your worksheet, and resize the visualizations to fit the dashboard.
